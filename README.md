# Factorio Power Calculator

**Created for my personal use only**

Helps calculate required amount of solar panels / accumulators / generators based on power consumption, fuel and generator properties.

## Important notes

- I call MJ "Energy" and MW/kW "Power" in this app.
- I use formulas and data from [Factorio Wiki](https://wiki.factorio.com) and [Factorio Cheat Sheet](https://factoriocheatsheet.com/#electricity).
- All calculations are approximate and do not pretend on being precise.
- I do not intend to develop the app into anything commonly useful.

## To run the application...

You need to download it, install dependencies (`yarn install`) and run it (`yarn start`).

The app will open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\
The page will reload if you make edits.

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic UI
- [ ] Basic functionality
- [ ] Solar / fuel switch
- [ ] MW / kW switch
- [ ] Presets for popular mods (Krastorio 2, SE, etc.)
- [ ] Per-field presets (generators, fuel, etc.)
